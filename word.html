			<p>5.Products</p>
			<p>The pipeline online seal assembly (medium and low pressure) consists of three parts, namely high strength fiber, high strength filler and high performance adhesive. In repairing the defects, the filler is first used for filling and leveling up on the defective parts, and then the high density composite composed of high strength fiber cloth and adhesive is wound outside the pipeline. The high density composite has high tensile strength and elastic modulus after curing, which can effectively control the pipeline deformation at the defect area, for reinforced remediation of pipeline defects.
			</p>
			<p>Die-less seal customization, meets the needs of various industries, and provides a complete solution of fluid seal.Die-less CNC machining equipment and materials from Austria can provide a full range of turning seals. From selection to mass customization, we can promise:It is the first company in China that can provide a full circle 3.6 meter seal with special processing technology and no restriction on structure. We can provide more comprehensive materials: polyurethane rubber plastic material.
			</p>
			<p>Customized molding constant temperature component</p>
			<p>Excellent heat insulation and heat preservation effect</p>
			<p>Good high temperature resistance, with maximum temperature up to 1200.</p>
			<p>Simple and convenient installation and dismantling, reusable </p>
			<p>Long service life</p>
